The noise in the image makes it difficult to process it automatically. The noises have a different nature, and for its successful suppression it is necessary to determine an adequate mathematical model. Let's consider the most common noise models. When using OpenCV noise have to be added manually, however the `skimage` Python toolbox proveides `skimage.util.random_noise()` function wich allows adding noise. We will try both ways."

Let us denote by $z_{min}$, $z_{max}$, $z_{med}$ minimum, maximum and median values of intensities in the window, $z_{i,j}$ is the pixel intensity value with coordinates $(i,j)$, $s_{max}$ is the maximum allowable window size. The adaptive median filtering algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",

    "\t3. Otherwise, the filtering result is $z_{i,j}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most widespread and efficient algorithms for extracting edges in an image is *Canny algorithm*. This algorithm allows not only to define edge pixels, but also connected boundary lines. The algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Elimination of small details by smoothing the original image using a Gaussian filter.\n",
    "2. Using the Sobel differential operator to determine the values of the all image pixels gradient modulus, and the calculation result is rounded by steps $45^{\\circ}$.\n",
    "3. Analysis of the gradient modules values of the pixels located orthogonally to the investigated one. If the gradient modulus value of the investigated pixel is greater than orthogonal neighboring pixels, then it is *edge*, otherwise it is *non-maximum*.\n",
    "4. Performing double threshold filtering of edge pixels selected in the previous step:\n",
    " - If the gradient modulus value greater the threshold $t_2$, then the edge presence in a pixel is valid.\n",
    " - If the gradient modulus value lower the threshold $t_1$, then the pixel is definitely not edge.\n",
    " - If the gradient modulus value in a range of $[t_1, t_2]$, then such a pixel is considered as $\\textit {ambiguous}$.\n",
    "5. Suppresses all ambiguous pixels not associated with valid pixels by 8-connectivity."
